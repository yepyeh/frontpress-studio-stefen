# FrontPress Studio — Documentation

Flat-file CMS in PHP. No database. Markdown files on disk for content, a React admin at `/admin`, themes that are plain `.twig` / `.php` files.

> **Working on the docs?** This folder is the authoring source — nested by category for browsing. The published site at `frontpress.studio/docs/` is a flat rendering with specific front-matter conventions. **Always follow [AUTHORING.md](AUTHORING.md) when adding or porting a doc to the site.**

## Where to start

If you've never touched the project before, read these in order:

1. [Installation → Quick start](installation/01-quick-start.md) — five-minute install on shared hosting or local dev.
2. [Features → Pages and posts](features/pages-and-posts.md) — create your first piece of content.
3. [Features → Themes](features/themes.md) — switch the look, or start building your own.
